As the sun set over the Manhattan skyline, Rachel Lee, a prominent figure in the tech world, stepped out of her office at Google's New York headquarters. She was on her way to meet with David Chu, CEO of WeWork, who had invited her to discuss potential collaboration between their companies.

Their meeting took place at WeLive, one of WeWork's residential buildings located in Hudson Yards, a complex developed by Related Companies and the Hudson Yards Development Corporation. Rachel had previously worked with Jonathan Gray, the CEO of Related Companies, on a project involving the redevelopment of Times Square.

As they sipped coffee, David mentioned his company's plans to expand its services into the healthcare sector, citing partnerships with medical research institutions such as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the NYU Langone Medical Center. Rachel shared her team's expertise in developing AI-powered health solutions, drawing from their work with companies like IBM Watson Health and athenahealth.

Their conversation was interrupted by an incoming call from John Chambers, founder of Emagine, who had invested heavily in WeWork's IPO. As they wrapped up their discussion, Rachel handed David a business card bearing her name and contact information, signaling the start of a new partnership between Google, WeWork, and their respective teams.
