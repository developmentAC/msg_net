As the sun set over the Manhattan skyline, Rachel Lee, a marketing specialist at IBM, sipped her coffee at the rooftop bar of the Westin Hotel. She was discussing the recent merger between IBM and Google with her colleague, John Chen, who represented the merged entity in New York.

Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Dr. Kenji Tanaka, a renowned expert on artificial intelligence, was meeting with representatives from SoftBank Investment Advisors to discuss potential partnerships for his new AI startup. The meeting was facilitated by Takeshi Nakamura, SoftBank's head of innovation.

In San Francisco, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai was announcing the launch of a new AI-powered platform, and IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna was in attendance, shaking hands with Pichai. Rachel had received an email from Krishna earlier that week, inviting her to join the IBM-Google team as a liaison.

As John Chen looked out at the city, he wondered if their merger would be enough to take down Microsoft, which was rumored to be working on its own AI-powered platform in Redmond, Washington.
